# ID_assignment-2
My project is a Studio Ghibli fan website. Where users can search for a film made by Studio Ghibli and get information about it like who is the director and when it was released etc. People who already watched the movie can leave their reviews of what they thought abt the movie for other people to see.
# Design Process
This website is for people who are looking for information about the Studio Ghibli films or people who don't know if they should watch a film or not as they can read the movie summary, watch the trailer and get the opinions of people who have alreadey watched the film through the reviews on the website to help them decide.
